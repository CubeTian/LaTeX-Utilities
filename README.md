# LaTeX-Utilities

An add-on to [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) that provides some fancy features that are less vital to the basic experience editing a LaTeX document, but can be rather nice to have.

## Features

-   Image Pasting (via `ctrl`+`shift`+`v` and "Paste an Image File")
-   Live Snippets (auto-activating, with regex)

## Requirements

-   [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop)
-   A LaTeX instillation in your path
